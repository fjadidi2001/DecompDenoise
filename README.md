Project Outline: Novel Image Denoising via Decomposition
#### 1. Problem Statement

* **Goal**: To develop a noise reduction strategy by decomposing an image into components such as structure, texture, and noise, and then denoising only the noise component.
* **Key Insight**: Decompose the image to confine the noise into a particular component to ensure minimal loss in image details.
#### 2. Proposed Approach

Hybrid Multi-Scale Decomposition (HMSD)  
Employ wavelet transforms and bilateral filtering to carry out a two-step decomposition:
1. **Level 1**: Bilateral filtering decomposes an image into two layers.
  Base Layer: Low-frequency structural information.
  Detail Layer: High-frequency details and noise.
2. **Level 2**: Apply wavelet decomposition on the detail layer to further isolate noise.
  Wavelet Subbands: High-frequency subbands contain most of the noise.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Apply spatially varying thresholds based on local variance to suppress noise while preserving edges.
3. **Reconstruction**: Combine the processed wavelet coefficients back into the detail layer, then combine with the base layer.
**Novelty**:  

- Combines spatial (bilateral filter) and frequency (wavelet) decompositions.
- Adaptive thresholding adapted to local image statistics.
#### **3. Implementation Steps**

1. **Decomposition**:
   - Use `OpenCV` for bilateral filtering.
- Employ `PyWavelets` for wavelet decomposition, say, Daubechies wavelets.
2. **Noise Reduction**:
   - Calculate local variance in wavelet subbands for adaptive threshold determination
   - Soft-threshold the high-frequency coefficients
3. **Reconstruction**:
   - Inverse wavelet transform on the denoised detail layer
   - Weighted addition with the base layer
#### **4. Evaluation Metrics**

- **Quantitative**: PSNR, SSIM on datasets such as BSD68 or Set12.
- **Qualitative**: Visual comparison with the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., BM3D, Non-Local Means).
#### **5. Tools & Libraries**

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV`: Bilateral filtering and image I/O.
  - `PyWavelets`: Wavelet decomposition.
  - `scikit-image`: Metrics (PSNR, SSIM).
  - `NumPy/Matplotlib`: Array operations and visualization.
#### **6. Challenges & Solutions**

- **Over-Smoothing**: Use edge-aware bilateral filtering and adaptive thresholds.
- **Noise Residuals**: Perform the decomposition on residual layers in an iterative way.
- **Complexity**: Enhance code with vectorization and parallel processing.
#### **7. Expected Outcomes**

- A denoising technique that will outperform conventional methods in terms of edge/texture preservation.
- Code repository with modular implementation for reproducibility.
#### **8. Future Work**

- Extend to video denoising or 3D medical imaging.
- Incorporate deep learning to automate parameter tuning.
### **Conclusion**


It draws, by design, on the favorable features of both the spatial and frequency-domain decompositions for noise removal. Emphasis has gone towards the adaptive processing of high-frequency components whereby image details considered critical will not be significantly sacrificed for very superior performance of denoising.
